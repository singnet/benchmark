Modern version of guile, current atomspace.

Guile: guile (GNU Guile) 2.9.2.14-1fb399
Atomspace: git log
commit a015b988246cd042cba836b30e050032fd5feca3
    Merge: 978d997 e167406

Not sure, I think the compiler was this (that's what it was in May...)
compiler: gcc version 6.3.0 (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1) 6.3.0 20170516
glibc: ldconfig -V (Debian GLIBC 2.24-11+deb9u4) 2.24

Repeated testing. Run as "guile -l nano-en.scm".
Got this:

Elapsed: 124 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.2153 secs/word Rate=1233.1 cnts/sec
Elapsed: 123 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.2135 secs/word Rate=1243.1 cnts/sec
Elapsed: 128 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.2222 secs/word Rate=1194.6 cnts/sec
Elapsed: 123 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.2135 secs/word Rate=1243.1 cnts/sec
Elapsed: 126 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.2188 secs/word Rate=1213.5 cnts/sec


As can be seen, there is relatively little variation, from run to run,
in the measured performance.

Performance improves by a lot. But why? Going back to the above git
version, but with today's compiler, shows:

Elapsed: 87 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.1510 secs/word Rate=1757.5 cnts/sec
Elapsed: 88 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.1528 secs/word Rate=1737.5 cnts/sec
Elapsed: 89 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.1545 secs/word Rate=1718.0 cnts/sec

Compare to today's git (and today's compilers, etc.), below, which runs
slightly slower (despite fixes to the AtomTable) (perhaps recent pattern
matcher mods slowed things down?). So conclude: **all** of the perf
improvement can be ascribed to either the compiler, or the different
glibc version (the `perf_events` tool suggests that a lot of CPU time,
about 16% of it, is spent in `std::__shared_ptr<opencog::Atom, etc`
and another 5% is in `std::_Rb_tree<opencog::Handle, etc.`) So this is
definitely a "wow" moment.

guile (GNU Guile) 2.9.2
gcc version 8.3.0 (Debian 8.3.0-6)
ldconfig (Debian GLIBC 2.28-10) 2.28
git commit f96a6c7bd0c3c41e06668b810193cad4d2d6dc4c

Three runs with *exactly* the same times:

Elapsed: 89 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.1545 secs/word Rate=1718.0 cnts/sec
Elapsed: 89 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.1545 secs/word Rate=1718.0 cnts/sec
Elapsed: 89 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.1545 secs/word Rate=1718.0 cnts/sec

Again: with guile (GNU Guile) 2.9.7-dirty
Elapsed: 89 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.1545 secs/word Rate=1718.0 cnts/sec

so no change at all for the newer guile version. Hmmm.

-------------
try this:
HUGETLB_MORECORE=yes LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libhugetlbfs.so.0 guile -l nano-en.scm

Wow! Even for this relatively small test, the difference is dramatic!
Elapsed: 72 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg= 0.125 secs/word Rate=2123.7 cnts/sec
Elapsed: 71 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.1233 secs/word Rate=2153.6 cnts/sec
Elapsed: 70 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.1215 secs/word Rate=2184.3 cnts/sec

And again: on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS:
gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.11)
ldconfig (Ubuntu GLIBC 2.23-0ubuntu11) 2.23
guile (GNU Guile) 2.9.2.36-89e28
atomspace git: 6904dc0c2f0d3b122d46d5b00a6d28a0f2bfa279 (6 Sept 2019)

Elapsed: 133 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.2309 secs/word Rate=1149.7 cnts/sec
Elapsed: 134 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.2326 secs/word Rate=1141.1 cnts/sec
Elapsed: 134 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.2326 secs/word Rate=1141.1 cnts/sec

and again, with todays atomspace git:
git commit dc7bf87bdf51e0afd3a0870fd73f172bcd80239d

Elapsed: 124 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.2153 secs/word Rate=1233.1 cnts/sec
Elapsed: 122 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.2118 secs/word Rate=1253.3 cnts/sec
Elapsed: 122 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.2118 secs/word Rate=1253.3 cnts/sec

Conclude: some atomspace changes made a difference. But also, the compiler
and/or glibc is making a huge difference.

After pull req opencog/atomspace#2464 which avoids some pointless
IncomingSet wasteage, I now measure:

Elapsed: 60 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.1042 secs/word Rate=2548.4 cnts/sec
Elapsed: 59 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.1024 secs/word Rate=2591.6 cnts/sec
Elapsed: 59 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.1024 secs/word Rate=2591.6 cnts/sec

Prior reesult for this was 72 secs (fanny, with hugetlb).

After rework on direct upward moves, now hitting

Elapsed: 58 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.1007 secs/word Rate=2636.3 cnts/sec

Disabling #define DEBUG in the pattern matcher takes us down one more
second:

Elapsed: 57 secs Tot-cnt=152904 Avg=0.0990 secs/word Rate=2682.5 cnts/sec
