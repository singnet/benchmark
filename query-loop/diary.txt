Got this with ordinary pages (not hugetlb):

Analyzed 681 genes in 137.09 seconds
Analyzed 681 genes in 141.01 seconds
Analyzed 681 genes in 141.91 seconds

Got this w/ hugetlb: (2MB pagesize)

Analyzed 681 genes in 106.90 seconds
Analyzed 681 genes in 105.89 seconds
Analyzed 681 genes in 107.60 seconds

This is using the AtomSpace of the day.

The above are the triangle-dataset, only. Repeat, with hugetlb, for the
combined dataset, triangles and pentagons:

Triangle relations for 681 genes in 131.95 seconds
Triangle relations for 681 genes in 141.52 seconds
Triangle relations for 681 genes in 141.10 seconds
Protein expression for 12 pathways in 101.21 seconds
Protein expression for 12 pathways in 105.71 seconds
Protein expression for 12 pathways in 107.90 seconds
Protein expression for 704 pathways in 4895.7 seconds

Wow!  Looks like loading up all that additional data slowed down
the triangle-search by 30%!  That's not ... good.
