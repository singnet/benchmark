; Similar to bio-loop.scm and bio-loop2.scm, but using QueryLink.
; Unlike those, this runs multiple threads so that parallelism
; performance can be understood. To make the benchmarks comparable,
; this still performs counting, so as to count the number of times
; a gene appears in a triangle.
;
; The code below is partly a cut-n-paste of bio-loop2.scm, with
; various changes to make it multi-threaded.
