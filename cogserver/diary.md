Cogserver shell performance notes
=================================

11 March 2019
-------------
spured by bug
   https://github.com/singnet/language-learning/issues/179

create very super-simplistic `shell-bench.pl`

Results (on `fanny`):
```
    $ ./shell-bench.pl

    Cogserver shell performance test, NREP=1000
    Elapsed=6.544488 secs; shell cmds; msecs-each=6.544488
    Elapsed=31.836581 secs; trivial guile cmds; msecs-each=31.836581
    Elapsed=31.883032 secs; non-trivial guile cmds; msecs-each=31.883032
    Elapsed=31.876574 secs; trivial Atoms; msecs-each=31.876574
    Elapsed=31.830150 secs; non-trivial Atoms; msecs-each=31.830150
```
So entering guile takes about 6x longer than entering the cogserver shell!
(Well, not really, this is a false/misleading result, it's actually netcat
weirdness; see further below.)

According to top:
* When doing the shell commands, cogserver runs at about 2% of CPU.
* When doing the guile commands, cogserver runs at about 10% of total cpu
* Meanwhile -- the perl command doing the timing runs at about 2% of CPU time.

See above github issue for wild guesses as to why.
```
   sudo nice -n -10 ./shell-bench.pl
```
does not alter the perf profile.

Changing `nc -q 0 localhost 17001` to `nc -q 0 -n 127.0.0.1 17001`
has no effect at all on performance.

Native sockets
--------------
Instead of using netcat, just open a socket (in perl) write to it,
and close. What's the performance then? It depends. If its "open a
socket, write message, wait for full reply, close" then its:
```
    Elapsed=30.523183 secs; direct logger+response; msecs-each=101.743943
```
If its "open a socket, write message, don't wait, close", then its
```
    Elapsed=18.459016 secs; direct logger; msecs-each=6.153005
```
In the former, cogserver CPU-usage runs at 2% to 4%. In the latter,
cpu usage runs 200% to 300%.

So, the CPU usage is about 80x greater for don't-wait-for-reply case.
The throughput is about 16x faster (elapsed time) so I guess there's
a lot of CPU waste with multi-threading. Each command is super-short,
so, of course the cogserver will waste a lot of time creating and
dstroying threads, entering and exiting guile in each thread.

According to `htop`, the cogserver is running 30-80 threads when its
running in the close-don't-wait mode.
```
    htop -- S for setup, columns, NLWP column for threads.
```

After cleanup of benchmark script. Pretty-print, etc. These are same
results as above, just printed nicely.
